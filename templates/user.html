      <h3>Who is a badge Earner?</h3>
      <p>
        An earner is someone who collects and stores their badges within the Open Badge Infrastructure. The <abbr title="Open Badge Infrastructure">OBI</abbr> acts as the conduit between an issuer and an earner, permitting an earner to earn, accept, store, and manage badges within their Mozilla Backpack. From there they can choose to display their badges on a variety of sites, including blogs, social media sites, and personal websites.

        <li>
        <strong>Promote yourself.</strong> You can create groups of badges that can be shared with different audiences and websites which allows you to manage and curate your accomplishments and showcase them.

      <h3>What is the Badge Backpack?</h3>
      <p>
        The Backpack is your main interface for collecting, managing, grouping and sharing your badges. When you earn badges on participating <abbr title="Open Badge Infrastructure">OBI</abbr> issuer sites, you can push them directly into your Backpack. You can also import badges stored elsewhere into the Backpack. However, these badges must be <abbr title="Open Badge Infrastructure">OBI</abbr> compliant as well.
